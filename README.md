Its a **single code base** website and new tab (cross-)browser extension.

To install the project, first make sure you have NodeJS and NPM installed. Preferably, the latest versions, but anything not extremely old should work too. Then, simply run `npm install`. Then:

1. To build the extension distribution files, run:
    ```bash
    npm run build:extension
    ```

1. To build the extension distribution files and re-build (watch) in case of changes, run:
    ```bash
    npm run build:extension:watch
    ```

1. To build the website distribution files, run:
    ```bash
    npm run build:website
    ```

1. To build the website distribution files and re-build (watch) in case of changes, run:
    ```bash
    npm run build:extension:watch
    ```

Finally, load the extension:

- In Chrome:
    - Navigate to chrome://extensions
    - Select "Developer Mode" and then click "Load unpacked extension..."
    - From the file browser, choose the `dist/extension/` directory

- In Firefox:
    - Navigate to `about:debugging`
    - Click "Load Temporary Add-on" and from the file browser, choose the `manifest.json` file in the `dist/extension/` directory
